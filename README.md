Insurance Claims Prediction Pipeline

Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline for predicting insurance claims using customer data. It includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment via MLflow. The pipeline is designed to run on a daily schedule for making predictions and saving the results to a CSV file. The pipeline also includes a feature for monthly retraining of the model based on new data.
